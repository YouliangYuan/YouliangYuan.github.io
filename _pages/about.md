About Me
======
Youliang Yuan is currently a PhD student at the [School of Data Science](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/en), [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en). He holds a Master's degree from the School of Computer Science, Wuhan University and a Bachelor's degree in the School of Physics Science and Engineering from Tongji University.

Youliang is under the guidance of Professor [Pinjia He](https://pinjiahe.github.io/), with a focus on using systematic methodologies in software engineering, particularly testing technologies, to improve the reliability of AI systems, especially large language models. Currently, he is interning at Tencent AI Lab under Dr. [Zhaopeng Tu](http://www.zptu.net/)'s supervision.

His research interest lies principally in the security and alignment, hallucination, instruction-following, and out-of-distribution generalization abilities of large language models. My current goal is to conduct interesting and impactful research, and I'm working hard toward this.
